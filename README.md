# Rust Learning Repository

This repository contains Rust applications to handle a deck of cards, manage bank accounts with various functionalities, and extract error logs from a log file.

## Project Structure

- `deck/`: Contains the Rust application for managing a deck of cards.
- `bank/`: Contains the Rust application for managing bank accounts.
- `media/`: Contains the Rust application for managing different types of media (Book, Movie, Audiobook, Podcast).
- `logs/`: Contains the Rust application for extracting error logs from a log file.
- `iter/`: Contains the Rust application for iterating through a vector and finding a value in a vector.

## Functionalities

### Deck Application

1. **Shuffle**: Randomly shuffles the deck of cards.
2. **Draw**: Draws a card from the deck.

### Bank Application

1. **Withdraw**: Withdraws an amount from an account.
2. **Deposit**: Deposits an amount into an account.
3. **Summary**: Prints a summary of the account and bank.

### Media Application

1. Create a catalog of media items (Book, Movie, Audiobook, Podcast).
2. Add a new media item to the catalog.
3. Describe media and catalog items.

### Logs Application

1. **Extract Errors**: Extracts error logs from a log file.

### Iter Application

1. **Iterate**: Iterates through a vector and finds a value in a vector.
